## Boilerplate with ElectronJS and NextJS.

To use this boilerplate you will need clone the repository with the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/juniorosorio47/boilerplate-electronjs-nextjs.git`


Now you can open the terminal on the path that you cloned the application and you can install the dependencies with the following command:
`npm install`


After installing the dependencies, you can start the NextJS dev server and after you need to open another terminal and start the ElectronJS dev server with the following commands:
`npm run dev` -- Will start the NextJS dev server.


In a new terminal:
`npm start` -- Will start the ElectronJS dev server.



And **BOOOM!!!** You have an application using NextJS and Electron.

**About production build, we will talk about it later.**
